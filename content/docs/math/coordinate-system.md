# Coordinate system

This page briefly covers Mach's coordinate systems; then it delves into _traversing coordinate systems_ explaining at a high-level (and with very minimal maths) how e.g. a polygon in a 3D model in the scene goes through a bunch of coordinate system transforms before finally ending up as a pixel on the screen.

You don't have to read this whole page, but it might be worth skimming and taking a look at the diagrams!

## World space

3D models and 2D sprites are said to exist in **world space**, Mach uses a '**+Y up, left-handed**' coordinate system to represent objects in space. To visualize it, imagine your own eyes are the camera. Hold your left hand out in front of you in a thumbs-up pose, as if you were holding a stick:

* X goes through the back side of your palm, towards your fingernails
* Y goes through the bottom of your hand towards the tip of your thumb
* Z goes through your eyes and towards your thumb
* Positive rotation values follow the direction of your fingers curled around the stick (any axis)

## Quick reference

| What                                | Coordinate system                             |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| World space                         | +Y up, left-handed                            |
| Texture coordinates                 | +Y down; (0, 0) is at the top-left corner and the first texel in memory address order. (1, 1) is the last texel in memory address order. |
| Framebuffer coordinates             | +Y down; (0, 0) is at the top-left corner     |
| Normalized device coordinates (NDC) | +Y up; (-1, -1) is at the bottom-left corner  |

## Mach vs. other software

## Traversing coordinate systems

Ever wondered how a vertex on a 3D model in a scene ultimately ends up on the 2D screen? We'll walk through the various _coordinate system transformations_ involved in that in the next section: [traversing coordinate systems](../traversing-coordinate-systems)
