    <br/>
    As you look through the docs, know that Mach is experimental and incomplete.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We’re planning a fully-fledged set of deeply integrated tools, a proper editor, the whole deal-we’re not kidding around here-and part of this means that the current APIs are likely to change. Some parts of Mach are more or less stable than others.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <a href="modularity">Mach is modular</a> and can be used in a few different ways: as 'a standard library' of Zig gamedev modules, as an alternative to the classic GLFW/SDL/Raylib/etc, or as a full engine similar to Unreal/Unity/Godot.
