# Moved

Mach core has moved into the Mach standard library as a _module_. You can:

* Check out the latest [docs](/docs) or the [`examples/` in `main`](https://github.com/hexops/mach)
* Or you might be looking for the older `0.4` branch of Mach, and the docs for that version: https://machengine.org/v0.4/core/
