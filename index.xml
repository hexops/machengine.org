There won&amp;rsquo;t be one major event where it is suddenly declared stable, rather it will be a bunch of small/incremental releases building up to it. You can look at the roadmap to get an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;re working on currently, and what will come later.
Can I use Mach to make a simple 2D game? Quite possibly! Check out Lord of Zero and Pixi for some ideas of what you could do.</description></item><item><title>fastfilter</title><link>https://machengine.org/pkg/fastfilter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/pkg/fastfilter/</guid><description>Moved This page was removed and/or deleted.

&amp;lsquo;standard library&amp;rsquo; of Zig gamedev modules Mach is a &amp;lsquo;standard library&amp;rsquo; of Zig gamedev modules. For example, you can import and use just specific parts of Mach like the mach.math library and use these to build your own engine.
Alternative to GLFW/SDL + OpenGL/Vulkan, Raylib, etc Many folks join the Mach and Zig communities looking to &amp;lsquo;make games mostly from scratch&amp;rsquo; using something minimal like GLFW+OpenGL, SDL+Vulkan, Raylib, etc.</description></item><item><title>mach opus</title><link>https://machengine.org/pkg/mach-opus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/pkg/mach-opus/</guid><description>Moved This page was removed and/or deleted.

Column-major matrix storage Column-vectors (i.e. right-associative multiplication, matrix * vector = vector) The benefit of using this &amp;ldquo;OpenGL-style&amp;rdquo; matrix is that it matches the conventions accepted by the scientific community, it&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll find in linear algebra textbooks. It also matches WebGPU, Vulkan, Unity3D, etc. It does NOT match DirectX-style which e.g. Unreal Engine uses.
Note: many people will say &amp;ldquo;row major&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;column major&amp;rdquo; and implicitly mean three or more different concepts; to avoid confusion we&amp;rsquo;ll go over this in more depth below.</description></item><item><title>Matrix storage</title><link>https://machengine.org/engine/math/matrix-storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/engine/math/matrix-storage/</guid><description>Moved This page was removed and/or deleted.

We encourage others to adopt the same Zig version Mach uses, since Zig packages which target latest nightly (or the latest stable release) will very often be incompatible otherwise.
Why nominated Zig versions, instead of nightly or stable? TL;DR: it&amp;rsquo;s a sweetspot between stable and nightly.
Stable releases occur just once or twice per year, nominated Zig versions occur several times per year - but not every day like nightly.</description></item><item><title>Object system: modules</title><link>https://machengine.org/docs/object/modules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/docs/object/modules/</guid><description>Object system: modules Mach modules are a key concept of the Mach object system. Mach modules (not to be confused with Zig modules, although they are very similar) are the &amp;lsquo;building blocks&amp;rsquo; used to organize everything in Mach itself, as well as in your own application. You can pick and choose which modules your program uses, import third-party libraries that provide modules, etc.
Examples of modules: a physics engine, a 2D sprite renderer, a text renderer, a scene manager, your application&amp;rsquo;s main logic, etc.</description></item><item><title>Object system: objects</title><link>https://machengine.org/docs/object/objects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/docs/object/objects/</guid><description>Object system: objects Mach objects are a key concept of the Mach object system and are used to represent everything from virtual objects like textures and shaders, to visual in-game objects and more!
Declaring objects Objects are declared just like a modules&amp;rsquo; global state fields - the only difference is the data type of the struct field.

Among other things, this allows for attaching your own arbitrary data to someone else&amp;rsquo;s object - a form of relaxed type constraint which enable you to quickly iterate on your codebase. *Mach&amp;rsquo;s object system is not an Entity Component System (it&amp;rsquo;s better!), but ECS typically enables this form of relaxed type constraint to enable fast iteration - and object relations are how we provide this flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Object system: systems</title><link>https://machengine.org/docs/object/systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/docs/object/systems/</guid><description>Object system: systems Mach systems are a key concept of the Mach object system. Systems are functions, or a list of systems (functions), that could be run if desired.
Declaring systems To declare a system, one simply needs to add the name of the system to a pub const mach_systems list in the module:
pub const mach_module = .foo; // ... pub const mach_systems = .{ .init, .tick, .deinit }; The names written in this list (.</description></item><item><title>Platform support</title><link>https://machengine.org/about/platforms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/about/platforms/</guid><description>Platform support We aim to support a broad array of operating systems and architectures, as long as they are reasonably used by desktop/mobile consumers, or someone would like to contribute and maintain support for them.

usingnamespace is prohibited usingnamespace in general is prohibited from use in Mach code, it allows one to &amp;lsquo;mixin&amp;rsquo; namespaces and in our view tends to produce increasingly worse code quality over time.</description></item><item><title>Traversing coordinate systems</title><link>https://machengine.org/docs/math/traversing-coordinate-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/docs/math/traversing-coordinate-systems/</guid><description>Traversing coordinate systems Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve got a 3D model in a scene, a virtual camera is viewing it.
