These aren’t Zig bindings to these libraries (which we have separately), but instead are just forks of the actual project with their build system replaced by build.zig so you can depend on them and build them using the Zig package manager.
Pure forks with build.zig:

Initially a 100% clean-room implementation, working from first-principles; later informed by research into how other open-source ECS work. Enable deep tooling to provide tracing, editors, visualizers, profilers, etc. Fast, optimal for CPU caches, multi-threaded, leverage comptime for type safety. Dynamic, allow for very flexible runtime capabilities.

Enables Linux games written in Zig to request gamemode be enabled, opting in to various CPU, GPU, and kernel optimizations. If the user&amp;rsquo;s machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t have gamemode, it simply does nothing. There are no dependencies and your game will still run without it normally.
This is preferred as it means your game will automatically invoke gamemode for the user when running, rather than them having to manually enable it.</description></item><item><title>mach glfw</title><link>https://machengine.org/v0.2/pkg/mach-glfw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/v0.2/pkg/mach-glfw/</guid><description>GitHub repository | Issue tracker Perfected GLFW bindings for Zig, with 100% API coverage, zero-fuss installation, cross compilation, and more.
