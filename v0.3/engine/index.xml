Description Opinionated? Modularity? Note Libraries Not at all Extremely No natural interoperability, lots of glue code required Frameworks Somewhat Very Often unable to provide high-level experiences due to modularity Engines Extremely Not at all Provides high-level experiences but makes rigid choices on your behalf The Mach project provides some Libraries, but mostly aims to sit between Frameworks and Engines.</description></item><item><title>Engine roadmap</title><link>https://machengine.org/engine/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machengine.org/engine/roadmap/</guid><description>Engine roadmap There is a long road ahead: it&amp;rsquo;s going to require a lot of work and time to get to where we are going.

FAQ: "Can I use Mach to make a simple 2D game?"
Getting Started with Mach engine Coming soon.

Using mach.math as a separate library Let&amp;rsquo;s take for example mach.math, our math library. Unlike other gamedev math libraries which may try to support a bunch of different coordinate systems in order to support various graphics APIs, ours is specifically for Mach&amp;rsquo;s design goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
